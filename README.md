# PGI3_Neurosky
Code for my Pixelles Game Incubator 3 Neurosky game!

Most of this is taken from developer.neurosky.com/docs/doku.php?id=using_thinkgear_with_unity

In the future I'll work on adding comments to help people who are just starting out with Neurosky/Unity programming

Be warned, this is not the way to do it with the free unity version (ie. I opted for the plugin). 

I tried to do it the non-plugin way, but I need this working by next week for a demo, which means I couldn't spend the extra time reducing the lag... Hopefully I'll get around to it eventually!
